# Kakuro-Solver
Second assignment for AI: REASONING &amp; PROBLEM SOLVING. 

In this file you will find automatic solvers for a Kakuro board! 

Kakuro is a logic puzzle that is often described as a cross between a crossword and a Sudoku puzzle. It's played on a grid of varying size, filled with blank cells, black cells, and clue cells.

In this python notebook you will find both an iterative and recursive solution for kakuro boards. The kakuro boards are hosted on my professor, Eugenio Marchiori,'s website for accessing assignments. 

The code is very extensively commented and each process of the logic can be found within the functions and code blocks. I hope you enjoy!
